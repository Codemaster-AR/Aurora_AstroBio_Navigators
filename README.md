It looks like I stopped abruptly\! I apologize for the interruption. I will provide the complete and consolidated README instructions, including the crucial macOS-only note, the Bash commands, and the manual steps, exactly as requested.

## üíª AuroraGeneLab Setup Guide for macOS (Bash Instructions)

This guide provides the complete procedure to acquire both the source code and the compiled application, organize them into the required **`AuroraGeneLab`** folder, and launch the **Aurora AstroBio Navigators** app.

### **Part 1: Initial Setup and Cloning (Terminal Commands)**

These commands will create the main project folder on your Desktop and clone the source code repository into it.

1.  **Open your Terminal** application (found in `/Applications/Utilities/`).

2.  **Execute the following commands** one by one:

    ```bash
    # 1. Navigate to the Desktop directory
    cd ~/Desktop/

    # 2. Create the main project directory named AuroraGeneLab
    mkdir AuroraGeneLab

    # 3. Navigate into the new directory
    cd AuroraGeneLab

    # 4. Clone the Aurora_AstroBio_Navigators source code
    git clone https://github.com/Codemaster-AR/Aurora_AstroBio_Navigators.git
    ```

After running these commands, the source code will be located in **`~/Desktop/AuroraGeneLab/Aurora_AstroBio_Navigators/`**.

-----

### **Part 2: Download the Application (Manual)**

The executable application must be downloaded separately from the web and placed directly inside the main setup folder.

1.  **Visit the Download URL:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the application download page:
    [https://astro-bio-navigator.w3spaces.com/](https://astro-bio-navigator.w3spaces.com/)

2.  **Download the App:**
    Click the appropriate link or button on the website to download the application package (this will typically be a `.dmg` or `.zip` file).

3.  **Move the File:**
    Move the downloaded file from your Downloads folder directly into the **`~/Desktop/AuroraGeneLab`** folder.

-----

### **Part 3: Finalize and Run**

Your `AuroraGeneLab` folder should now contain the source code folder and the downloaded app file.

1.  **Verify Structure:** Go to your **Desktop** and open the **`AuroraGeneLab`** folder. It should contain two main items:

      * The **`Aurora_AstroBio_Navigators`** folder (from the clone).
      * The **Downloaded App File** (e.g., `AstroBio_App.dmg`).

2.  **Launch the Application:**

      * **Double-click** the downloaded application file (the `.dmg` or `.app` file) inside the `AuroraGeneLab` folder to install or run the **Aurora AstroBio Navigators** application.
